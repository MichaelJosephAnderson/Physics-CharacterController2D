# Physics-CharacterController2D
C# code for a physics engine and character controller for a 2D platformer I have been working on.
The physics engine is based off of a unity tutorial, but I have adapted the code and controller to allow for variable jump height, double jumps, as well as a primitive wall jump.
I plan on continuing to add to this controller.
